<h2 style="color:yellow;">A little about Pismis 24-1...</h2>
<p style="color:white;">Pismis 24-1, also known as HD 319718, is the brightest star of the open cluster Pismis 24 within the nebula NGC 6357 about 6,500 light-years away. It was once thought to be the most massive star known, but is composed of at least three individual objects, each still among the most luminous and most massive stars known</p>
<h2 style="color:yellow;">Discovery</h2>
<p style="color:white;">
Pismis 24-1 was discovered as HD 319718 which was later resolved into both Pismis 24-1 and the fainter Pismis 24-16. The compact 10th-magnitude open cluster Pismis was found in 1959.
In 1973, Pismis 24 was resoled into 15 components of which 12 were considered member stars. The brightest is the one we call Pismis 24-1.
