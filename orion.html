    <h1 style="color:Azure;">Orion: The Hunter </h1>
<h2 style="color:Azure;">
Orion, the Hunter with his belt and sword, is a familiar presence in the night sky almost everywhere on the planet. Itâ€™s composed of very bright, faraway stars and nebulae, which means that long after apparent motion has distorted most of our other constellations beyond recognition, Orion will still shine as a beacon to people around the world. But not everywhere gets to see views like these. Observatories around the world worked together to make these composite images of the violently beautiful star nurseries in and near Orion, with data from many different parts of the EM spectrum. Looking at the sky in different spectra reveals very different portraits of the visible universe, including the deepest view of the Orion Nebula ever taken.
