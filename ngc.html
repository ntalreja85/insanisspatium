    <h2 style="color: azure;">What is NGC 247?</h2>
    <p style="color:Azure;">NGC 247 (also known as Caldwell 62 and commonly known as the Claw Galaxy[3]) is an intermediate spiral galaxy (although it is sometimes classified as a dwarf spiral galaxy) about 11.1 Mly away in the constellation Cetus. This distance was confirmed in late February 2011.

    <h2 style="color: azure;">What is so unreal about NGC 247?</h2>
    <p style="color: azure;">
    NGC 247 has an unusually large void on one side of its spiral disk. This void contains some older, redder stars but no younger, bluer stars.
    NGC 247 is one of several galaxies that is gravitationally bound to the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253). These galaxies form a small core in the center of the Sculptor Group, which is one of the nearest groups of galaxies to the Milky Way.[7] Most other galaxies associated with the Sculptor Group are only weakly gravitationally bound to this core.
    Initially, astronomers suggested that the void might have been caused by gravitational interactions with part of another galaxy. More recent research suggests the void could have formed when a blob of dark matter—theoretical, so far, undetected material that is estimated to account for 27 percent of the universe—plunged through the disk like a rock through tissue paper. The impact would have scattered stars and blown away the gas and dust for making more stars.
