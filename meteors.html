    <h2 style="color: azure;">What is Meteors?</h2>
    <p style="color:Azure;">A meteoroid is a streak of light in the sky caused by a meteoroid passing through Earth's atmosphere. Once this meteoroid enters the Earth's atmosphere it becomes a meteor. This meteor can be seen in the sky as a shooting star. Most meteors are observed at night.</p>
    <h2 style="color: azure;">Types of meteors</h2>
    <p style="color:Azure;">Meteorites are divided into three types:</p>
    <ol>
        <li style="color: azure;">Stony Meteorites (stones)</li>
            <p style="color: azure;">The majority of meteorite finds are stony meteorites, consisting mostly of silicate minerals.
                There are two main types of stony meteorite: chondrites (some of the oldest materials in the solar system) and achondrites (including meteorites from asteroids, Mars and the Moon).
                Both chondrites and achondrites have many subgroups based on their compositions, structures and the minerals they contain.
            </p>

        <li style="color: azure;">Iron Meteorites (irons)</li>
            <p style="color: azure;">Most iron meteorites are thought to be the cores of asteroids that melted early in their history. They consist mainly of iron-nickel metal with small amounts of sulphide and carbide minerals.
                During the decay of radioactive elements in the early history of the solar system, many asteroids melted and the iron they contained, being dense, sank to the centre to form a metallic core.
                Meteorites from melted asteroids are also known as differentiated meteorites, as they have experienced major chemical or physical changes, solidifying from a molten state.
            </p>
            <img src="iron meteorite.jpg" alt="Iron Meteorites">
        <li style="color: azure;">Stony Iron Meteorites (stony irons)</li>
            <p style="color: azure;">Stony-iron meteorites consist of almost equal parts iron-nickel metal and silicate minerals including precious and semi-precious gemstones.
                They are considered some of the most beautiful meteorites.
                There are two different types of stony-iron meteorites: pallasite and mesosiderite.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li style="color: azure;">Pallasites</li>
                    <p style="color: azure;">Pallasites contain big, beautiful olive-green crystals, a form of magnesium-iron silicate called olivine, embedded entirely in metal.
                        Sometimes the olivine does not occur as a single crystal but as a cluster. Elsewhere it can create a pattern of veins through solid metal.
                    </p>
                    <img src="pallasite.jpg" alt="pallasite">
                <li style="color: azure;">Mesosiderite</li>
                    <p style="color: azure;">Mesosiderite meteorites are breccias, a variety of rock composed of broken fragments of minerals or rock cemented together by a finer material.
                        The fragments are roughly centimetre-sized and contain a mix of igneous (solidified) silicate and metal clasts (rocks made of pieces of older rocks).
